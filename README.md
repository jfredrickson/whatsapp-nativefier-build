# Nativefier build for WhatsApp

Unofficial Nativefier build of WhatsApp that I use on my personal system.

## Usage

Run:

```
./build.sh
```

### Optional steps

Edit `whatsapp.desktop` with the correct path and copy it to a XDG desktop entry directory such as `/usr/share/applications` or `$HOME/.local/share/applications`.
